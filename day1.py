# # In Python, you can clone data using various methods depending on the type of data you want to clone. Here are some examples:

# #     Cloning lists: You can clone a list using the slicing operator [:]. For example:

# # css

# # original_list = [1, 2, 3]
# # cloned_list = original_list[:]

# # This creates a new list cloned_list with the same elements as the original list original_list.

# #     Cloning dictionaries: You can clone a dictionary using the copy() method. For example:

# # makefile

# # original_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
# # cloned_dict = original_dict.copy()

# # This creates a new dictionary cloned_dict with the same key-value pairs as the original dictionary original_dict.

# #     Cloning sets: You can clone a set using the copy() method. For example:

# # makefile

# # original_set = {1, 2, 3}
# # cloned_set = original_set.copy()

# # This creates a new set cloned_set with the same elements as the original set original_set.

# # Note that cloning data creates a new copy of the original data, so any changes made to the cloned data will not affect the original data. Cloning is useful when you want to create a backup or a copy of data that you want to modify without affecting the original data.
# string = "Hello, world!"
# substring = "world"

# if substring in string:
#     print("The substring is present in the string")
# else:
#     print("The substring is not present in the string")

# floatnum = float(input('enter a float num:'))
# print(floatnum,"",type(floatnum))

# def x(a):
#     if a==float(input('enter a float num')):
#        else
# #            print(a,'not a float num')
# x=(input('enter a numnber'))
# y=int(input('enter a numnber'))
# z=float(input('enter a numnber'))
# if type(x)!=str:
#     print('its not str ')
# else:
#     print('its a string')
